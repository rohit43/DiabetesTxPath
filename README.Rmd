# Learning Effective Clinical Treatment Pathways for Type-2 Diabetes from Observational Data.
This is an R package that can be used to execute T2D study. An in-depth discussion on the study design can be found at (link to protocol). Very briefly, the R-Package enables one to decipher effective treatment pathways of T2D in terms of controlling a) HbA1c b) less adverse events in terms of Myocardial Infraction c) less adverse events in terms of Kidney related disorders and d) less adverse events related to Eyes disorder. A step-by-step guide to execute this study is provided below: 

## Step-1
The package can be installed as follows:
```r
library("devtools")
install_github("rohit43/DiabetesTxPath")
```

## Step-2
Load the required libraries as follows:

```r
library("OhdsiRTools")
library("OhdsiSharing")
library("SqlRender")
library("DatabaseConnector")
library("CohortMethod")
library("gridExtra")
library("DiabetesTxPath")
```
## Step-3
Setup your JBC driver environment and connection details as follows:
```r
jdbcDrivers <- new.env()
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms = "yourDatabase", 
                                             server = "yourServer",
                                             user = "yourUserName", 
                                             password = "yourPassword",
                                             port = "yourPort")
```

## Step-4
Provide database schema name and other details as follows.

```r
cdmDatabaseSchema <- "nameOfYourCdmSchema"
resultsDatabaseSchema <- "nameOfResultsSchema"
targetDatabaseSchema <- "nameOfResultsSchema"
results_path <- "path to results folder" #where you want the results to be saved.
cdmVersion <- "5" #do not change this. Please note, this study can only be executed on CDMV5
numThread <- c(numericValue) #eg. 8 for 8 threads. Give as much as you can :) 
```

## Step-5
The complete study can be executed with a single function as shown below. Please note, this function will run the study for all the 4 different outcomes a)HbA1c b)Myocardial Infraction c)Kidney Disease and d)Eyes related disorders considered in this analysis.The script to run the complete study is below:

```r
runCompleteStudy(connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
                 cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,
                 resultsDatabaseSchema = resultsDatabaseSchema,
                 cdmVersion = cdmVersion,
                 numThread = numThread,
                 results_path = results_path)
```

Package the results as follows:
```r
packageResults(connectionDetails = connectionDetails, 
               cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema, 
               workFolder = results_path, 
               dbName = cdmDatabaseSchema)
```

Time of execution can vary from few hours to day or two, depending on the size of the dataset you have.
